# EYES

The proposed idea for senior project is to develop an accessible app for the visually impaired to help them navigate and virtually “see” the world around them. The app would aim have the following features: Text recognition, Object recognition, Scene recognition and Color Recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio 3.5
- Java
- Gradle
- Android Phone with API Level 21
- Google Firebase ML Kit
- Microsoft Computer Vision
- Google Text-to-Speech
- Google Speech Recognizer
- Camera Kit

### Installing

Installation would normally be done by downloading the application through the Google Play Store. If the application does not yet exist on the Google Play Store under the name “EYES”, then you will need to add the APK (Android Application Package) file to your device. The APK can be obtained by building the project with the android device of your choosing as the target.
To install an APK on your android device, you must have already enabled Developer Mode on your device. Instructions for each android version exist at the following link: (https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options)
Once developer mode has been enabled, the APK file can be selected and installed on the device. Before running the application, be sure to go into the app info and activate the required permissions. The application should prompt you to do so, but this helps speed up the process of testing the newly installed APK.
